# CS161B – Computer Science I: Programming Fundamentals

Welcome to my CS161B repository! This course is a continuation of CS161A, diving deeper into programming concepts using C++. This repo is organized to help me stay on track with assignments, keep a record of discussion posts, and retain what I learn through note-taking.

## 🌎 Environment
The environment used at PSU. I should probably get comfortable with this stack even if I don't end up transferring.

Computing System: All work is to be performed on the PSU linux systems
Compiler: GNU GCC C++ compiler using Modern C++ on MCECS linux systems
    g++ -std=c++17 program.cpp
Editors Allowed: vi, vim - NO OTHER EDITORS may be used

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `assignments/` – Programming assignments and projects.
- `discussions/` – Written responses to course discussion questions and prompts.
- `notes/` – Class notes, summaries, and references for review.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Pointers and dynamic memory management
- File I/O
- Structs
- Debugging in C++ with GDB

## 💡 Goals

My main goal in this course is to understand structs and dynamic memory. If I can walk away understanding exactly how structures are organized across memory slots, being comfortable working with dynamic memory (pointers, dereferencing, malloc and realloc), and be able to put together a basic but complete CLI crud application, I'll be satisfied.

Some secondary goals would be getting comfortable with tool use. 
  - I'd like to get comfortable doing most coding tasks in my editor (creating files, searching, find and replace, etc) without needing to touch my mouse.
  - Comfortable with the compile/debug workflow in the terminal for C++ apps.
  - Pickup a unit testing framework and start working on writing unit tests for assignments
